# This is Me

Hi, I'm Luis Maria Bendix, also known as luismbendix on GitHub. I'm a tech-savvy sports enthusiast and master's student in Product Development and Business Studies (currently in my first semester). When I'm not immersed in lines of code or smart home integrations, you'll likely find me on the golf course, lifting weights at the gym, or chasing adrenaline on gravel roads and mountain bike trails.
